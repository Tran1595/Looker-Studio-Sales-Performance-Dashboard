# Looker Studio - Sales Performance Dashboard


## Overview

Welcome to the Sales Data Visualization with Looker Studio repository! In this project, I harness the power of Looker Studio to transform raw sales data into interactive, insightful visualizations. The goal is to demonstrate how Looker Studio can be used to uncover valuable business insights and provide brief, actionable recommendations based on data analysis.

## Introducing Looker Studio

## Project Highlights

- Business Context: The sales data represents a fictitious retail company offering a variety of products, including technology devices, office supplies, and furniture. The company serves multiple customer segments across different regions. The dataset spans 2014 to 2017, providing a comprehensive view of sales trends and profitability, making it ideal for analysis and learning purposes.

- Interactive Dashboards: Using Looker Studio, I’ve developed dynamic dashboards that visualize sales performance across various dimensions, including time, product categories, customer segments, and regions.

- Visual Insights: The dashboards feature charts and key performance indicators, making it easy to identify trends, track revenue changes, and analyze order patterns.

## Analysis Summary

This report highlights a significant decline in monthly revenue, mainly due to a drop in non-returned orders. However, the yearly trend remains positive.

I. Insights:
- A key insight is that while returns increased by 20%, the major driver of the revenue drop was actually fewer successful purchases rather than just more returns.
Example: Revenue dropped by 29.23% MoM—mainly due to a decline in new orders.

- Overall decline in revenue for Corporate and Home Office segments. Consumer segment remained stable, with a slight increase. 
Example: Corporate Revenue significantly dropped from $44.64K in November to $20.52K in December.

- Furniture and Office Supplies performed well, but category Technology saw the biggest decline.
Example: Chairs had the biggest sales increase (+$405.24), while Machines saw the biggest drop (-$10.51K).

II. Suggest Actions: 
- Look at why fewer orders were placed, maybe due to pricing, seasonality, or market trends. 
- Also explore customer feedback on returns to reduce the return rate.


## Conclusion
By leveraging Looker Studio for data visualization, we can transform raw sales data into meaningful insights that drive strategic decisions. This project demonstrates the value of visual analytics in understanding business performance and identifying actionable opportunities for growth.
